# code-samples

## Overview

This repo contains a sampling of programs that demonstrate some useful skills I've learned in both educational and professional (including research) settings, but applied to conceptually simple problems to highlight fundamental concepts. More specific details about each program, including how to run them and descriptions of their outputs, are given in the README files in each of their folders.

## Programs

### Buffmo (Python)

The Buffmo program is a basic but comprehensive tutorial for generating noisy dynamical and measurement data and implementing a standard Kalman filter to perform estimation on the artifically unknown states.

### Myc-Drop (C++)

The Myc-Drop program trains a customizable, fully-connected deep neural network to classify each of the constituent samples in a mycological dataset as edible or poisonous based on a variety of attributes.

### Nevermore (C++)

The Nevermore program carries out a genetic algorithm that attempts to match an input phrase by propagating a random initial string with random mutations.

### Truss-Me (Python)

The Truss-Me program is a simple finite elements program for designing and testing truss structres composed of 2-node bar elements under applied forcing conditions and degree-of-freedom constraints.
