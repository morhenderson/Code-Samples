# code-samples

## Overview

The contents of this repo are a sampling of (very basic) programs and scripts demonstrating useful skills I've picked up. They include algorithms and methods I've learned in both educational and professional (including research) settings, but applied to conceptually simple problems to highlight fundamental concepts. More specific details about each program, including how to run them and descriptions of their outputs, are given in the README files in each of their folders.

## Programs

### Buffmo (Python)

The Buffmo program (Buffmo.py) is a basic but comprehensive tutorial for programmatically generating noisy dynamical and measurement data and implementing a standard Kalman filter to perform estimation on the artifically unknown states.

### Truss-Me (Python)

The Truss-Me program (Truss-Me.py) is a simple finite elements program for designing and testing truss structres composed of 2-node bar elements under applied forcing conditions and degree-of-freedom constraints.

### Myc-Drop (C++)

The Myc-Drop program (Myc-Drop) is a customizable fully-connected deep neural network for reading a mycological dataset and classifying each of the constituent samples as edible or poisonous.
